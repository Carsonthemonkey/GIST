App to summarize audio files.

This is a website that can transcribe audio like lectures and then summarize it using ChatGPT's API. It is still a work in progress, but it has functionality right now. It requires an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to work. This will charge you, but it is very cheap (usually less than a cent per summary, it is very negligable). I would highly recommend setting up a monthly spending limit in your OpenAI account settings under billing (5 dollars should be plenty) so that you do not have to worry about excess charges. Make sure you put you API key in the top left input box before attempting to transcribe or summarize. The site does not collect or store your API key in any way. There is also currently a word limit for summaries (roughly 4000 words give or take) so be make sure to check the word counter before you summarize. When summarizing, note that selecting the relevant topic from the topic dropdown will greatly improve summary results. If none of the topics match your audio, just select auto.
